# A Survey of the Architecture Enabling Technologies and Applications of the Internet of Things
The number of smart items is rapidly increasing. Tens of billions of objects will be
deployed globally by 2025, gathering a vast amount of data. Traditional computer
models collect data in the field and then send it to a central data center for analysis,
but this is no longer a viable strategy. To turn massive amounts of collected data
into useful information, new methodologies and technologies are necessary. In the
IoT ecosystem, technology will also enable interconnection around things, although
more study is needed in the development, convergence, and interoperability of the
many IoT pieces. By examining application scenarios and practical experiments, this
paper presents a picture of the essential technological components required to enable
the interconnection of things in order to actualize IoT concepts and applications in
the fields of agriculture, smart home security, and the automotive industry. Finally,
some key areas for future IoT research are suggested and briefly explored.
